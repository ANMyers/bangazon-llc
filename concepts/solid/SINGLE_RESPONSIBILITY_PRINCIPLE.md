# Single Responsibility Principle

> **Theoretical Explanation:** "There is one and only one reason to change a class."

This means that we should start to think small. Each complex problem cannot easily be solved as a whole. It is much easier to first divide the problem in smaller sub-problems. Each sub-problem has a reduced complexity compared to the overall problem and can then be tackled separately.

## Impact on Code

1. Easier to understand
1. Less error prone
1. More robust
1. Easier to test
1. More maintainable and extendable
